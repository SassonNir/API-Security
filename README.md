Today most of recent researches point out that API dominates over 60% of the overall worldwide traffic. API mechanisms are implemented in over 90% of software design in any software development company. 

These details bring API's to be one of the most favorite attack vector for hackers to gain access. In 2020 alone, 91% of organizations had an API security incident.

## Project goal

Our Supervised, CDR and Unsupervised approach safeguard any app-to-app communications and encourage compliance with standard documentation.
API dominates over 60% of the overall worldwide traffic which is implemented in over 90% of software design. In 2020 alone, 91% of organizations had an API security incident which is a cyber criminal favorite.


## Selected Approach

Our Supervised/CDR security mechanism combines conservative rule based and machine learning algorithms to analyze any incoming API request while abiding by RESTful API standards.
If an API spec is not provided, our Unsupervised approach uses machine learning algorithms and Cisco’s library functions  to build the Specification from incoming traffic.


### Defense Mechanism

By deep analyzing each and every incoming HTTP request we will invoke a strict set of rule based analysis which will prompt and invoke a trained machine learning algorithm to pin point any incoming anomaly even if it was never researched before. 

Some of the datasets for the machine learning model are public but some of then was even generated by our API team. 

### Gateway 
Through our Unsupervised approach, requests will be sent through a gateway server and a Specification obiding by OpenAPI standards will be created from the incoming traffic.  

### Backend

Our backend systems run state of the art API services designed internally in order to test the integrity of our system and to abide by latest market standards like REST and OpenAPI.
